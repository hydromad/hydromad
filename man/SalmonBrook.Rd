  Rainfall and streamflow for Salmon Brook at Salmon Catchment.
}
\description{
  Daily rainfall and streamflow for Salmon Brook at Salmon
  Catchment (Western Australia), from 1974-04-06 to 1999-03-16.
  The catchment area is 0.83 square kilometers.

  Salmon Brook is located in the low-relief Darling Range of
  southwestern Western Australia. Evapotranspiration consumes about 90
  per cent of the annual rainfall. The region is
  dominated by jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest. Surface soils are
  predominantly highly permeable sands and gravels (Ye et al., 1997).
